A puzzle dependency chart for Myst, and how its plotholes affect it.
<!--more-->
The original _Myst_ from 1993 has an intriguing setting, interesting puzzles, and an alluring backstory.

The Plot
--------

The actual plot of the game goes a little like this (beware of spoilers!):

You, the player, uses a magical book called a "Linking Book" to travel to a world ("Age") called Myst.

A man named Atrus has left a message for his wife Catherine, which sets the scene as you stumble upon it: One of their sons, Sirrus or Achenar, has destroyed most of Atrus's Linking Books to other worlds, so he locked the remaining Linking Books behind some access codes. In his library, you find a red and a blue Linking Book with missing pages torn out of them; through heavy static, you see and hear Atrus's sons, Sirrus and Achenar, who are apparently trapped inside the two books. They implore you to find the rest of the red and blue pages.

You figure out how to reach four different Ages: Channelwood, Stoneship, Mechanical and Selenitic Age. In each Age you find one red and one blue page for the red and blue Linking Books.

You also uncover some other clues off the beaten path, if you're vigilant. Sirrus seems to be very greedy and has probably plundered several Ages (and you find a letter to him from Achenar chastising him for it), and Achenar seems to be a twisted torturer who has murdered the inhabitants of several Ages. You also find a message from Sirrus saying "he is preparing" and "take only one page". Finally, you find (in Channelwood and Stoneship Age) two pieces of a note which tells you how to open a vault in a marker switch on Myst. Inside that vault is a single white page, which turns out to be the page Sirrus told Achenar to take.

After returning enough pages to Sirrus and/or Achenar, each brother tells a slightly different story, but the gist is the same: The other brother is guilty while he himself is wrongfully imprisoned, and their father is dead. The player is to retrieve the final red/blue page from a secret room in the library's fireplace; the brothers supply the access code there.

Inside the fireplace, the player finds the pages, but also a green book. Inside it is Atrus. He has been trapped there by his evil sons, who used Catherine to lure him there, and Atrus requires you to bring the white page his sons took from his Myst Linking Book and hid in the vault. The player does so, Atrus's Linking Book works again, and you win the game.

There is much more backstory to this plot, of course. There are many journals written by Atrus in the game, which flesh out the lore. Each Age has its own, self-contained puzzle that you need to solve to return to Myst with its pages. But this is the overarching structure of the game.

Myst Puzzle Dependency Chart
----------------------------

Inspired by the famous adventure game designer Rob Gilbert's [Puzzle Dependency Charts](https://grumpygamer.com/puzzle_dependency_charts), here's a puzzle dependency chart I made for Myst:

There are, however, some problems with the plot. Some aren't too significant, but some actually affect the puzzle dependency chart.

The Prison Book Retcon
----------------------

The first "plothole" is one that Cyan imposed upon themselves. In Myst, the red and blue books that trapped Sirrus and Achenar were special "Prison Books" that never led to any Age; they were designed to trap you in a void, but if you were trapped, you could see out of the book and communicate (talk) to anyone holding the book. Myst uses this to give the player the primary objective of the game: Sirrus and Achenar tell you to bring them red and blue pages. It also uses it to allow the player to solve the "Fireplace Code" part of the puzzle dependency chart above: Sirrus/Achenar tell you how to enter the secret fireplace room to retrieve the final page, which also leads you to Atrus. Confusingly, Atrus is _also_ able to see you and communicate with you through what is ostensibly a completely normal non-Prison Linking Book (did your head appear floating in front of him in the D'ni cave?).

Riven, the sequel to Myst (released in 1997), also used Prison Books as a major plot element. However, in 2000, Cyan employee and "D'ni historian" Richard A. Watson told Myst fans that this part of the plot was artistic license. In the "real", canon Myst lore, Prison Books do not exist! The red and blue books actually just linked to regular Ages, it's just that those Ages lacked any Linking Books back to Myst. _Myst IV: Revelation_ (2004), although not developed by Cyan at all, solidified this canon in an actual game.

So, Cyan retconned Myst (and Riven). The red and blue Linking Books weren't Prison Books, but regular Linking Books.

This creates a plothole, though. If you the player never communicate with Sirrus and Achenar in their Prison Ages, then how do you solve the fireplace puzzle?

Or to put it another way: If one were to "fix" Myst by plugging its plotholes and making it consistent with later Myst lore, how would one do that? It's clear that the fireplace puzzle needs to be shuffled around since Sirrus and Achenar can't give you the solution anymore, but it would still be desirable to gate the player, so you'd need to complete the four other Ages before you're able to enter the fireplace.

The Events Prior to the Game's Start
------------------------------------

The second plothole concerns the events that occured before the player sets foot on Myst Island: What actually happened, and in what order?

One major question is: Who tore out the pages from the red and blue books? Well, Atrus obviously did it. Who else? Did the pages magically scatter to other Ages when the brothers were imprisoned?

However, this raises the question: How did Sirrus and Achenar know that the final page was located in the fireplace? Perhaps Atrus told them, through the Prison Books while he tore out the pages, where he'd hide all the pages. Weird thing to do, but it's the only real explanation. In the retconned plot, though, he can't have told them where he'd hide the pages since he couldn't have talked to them. That's OK: Even if they knew, Sirrus and Achenar wouldn't be able to tell you through the book, as we've already established.

There are other issues, though:

1. Sirrus and Achenar lured Catherine to D'ni, so Atrus would follow her. Yet, Atrus's messages on Myst are to Catherine, so at this point he can't have known where Catherine was. He says he'll "see [Catherine] shortly"; why would he think that
2. When Atrus left the messages, Sirrus and Achenar had already burned his library. Did they not intend to trap Atrus in D'ni before they did so? Possibly, they burned the library to cover their tracks and to spur Atrus into action so he'd go to D'ni, and they'd be free to explore the red and blue books. But Atrus wasn't trapped when Sirrus and Achenar got trapped, as he tore out the pages.
3. In Atrus's message, he also says he'll go "find" Sirrus and Achenar to confront them with the library's destruction. Where are Sirrus and Achenar at this point? Are they already trapped in the red and blue books? Did Atrus go look for them, and immediately find them trapped? Or did he go through all the remaining Ages, find the clues to their wicked nature, then find them imprisoned, tear out the pages as punishment, and go back through the Ages to hide the pages?
4. Speaking of which... Why did Atrus hide the pages in the other Ages?
5. Why did Atrus tell Catherine that he locked the Linking Books to the other Ages behind access codes, and to "remember the tower rotation"? Why would Catherine need to go to the other Ages at this point? One possible explanation to this and the previous two points: He hid the pages in the Ages near the clues to their evil deeds, and he wanted Catherine to play detective and retrace his steps to realize their sons were bad. But that contradicts
6. Sirrus and Achenar removed a page from Atrus's Linking Book, so he wouldn't be able to return to Myst. They did so while Atrus was "preparing". Preparing to do what? Go somewhere? Go to D'ni to look for Catherine?

If anyone has any suggestions on how Myst's plot could be reconciled with the canonical lore, please share. I feel like this has to have been covered 

[Andrew "Zarf" Plotkin](http://blog.zarfhome.com/2020/12/reading-myst-for-detail.html) has written about this in some detail already, but there are a couple of pieces still missing to this puzzle, I feel.
