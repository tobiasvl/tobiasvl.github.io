I love the Myst games.

Obduction is, on paper, an amazing game.

The game places you in a small, Earth-like world. By solving a series of puzzles, you're able to "warp" between four different worlds.

The preceding paragraph describes both Myst and Obduction. 

I can almost picture the workshop design meetings where Cyan figured out the Obduction teleporting system. I assume it went something like this:

> OK, we screwed up the concept of Prison Ages in Myst, and had to retcon it later. The whole thing with Descriptive Books vs Linking Books was a bit confusing. The fact that you can rewrite an Age to some extent, but if you do it too much you'll change the link to a different Age... Let's streamline all this stuff, and also make it so the linking process itself can be used in puzzles!


Myst's sequel Riven had a couple of puzzles that forced you to consider the entire world of Riven. The puzzles were pervasive throughout the world.


I had some early-game issues with Obduction; specifically with the mine cart portion. I played on Xbox One with a controller, and I invert the Y axis on the right stick


Obduction has this as well. Unfortunately


SPOILERS

The Villein number system
-------------------------

Cyan likes their number systems. In Riven, you had to figure out a base-5 number system. In Obduction, you have to figure out a base-4 number system.

That is... You don't actually need to learn it. The number system is used by a group of aliens known as the Villeins, who graciously made a bunch of high-tech input pads that you can draw the numbers on.

These pads come with an "auto-correct" feature. If you draw an invalid number, the pads will attempt to re-arrange it into a valid number.

> In Maray, which is kind of the swampy-looking world, we started out with a much more extreme version of teach-and-test. The control panel that you use, and the numbering system that comes up there—it was much more sophisticated, and much more complicated. It was, I think, way too tough for certain groups of people. I think some people, those who have a math inclination, or who are wired in a certain way, probably would have gotten it, but it just became cumbersome to a certain extent. But I loved it.

> It was hard for me, because I really loved letting them do small things at first. Small things, small things, then bigger things. More complex things with control panels until we gave them the mother of all control panels.

> It was just too much. That was stuff that was kind of toned down, but we still kept that same kind of flavor, of little bits at a time, until we give you a larger thing at the end.

It's understandable to some extent... But also a pity.

I learned the number system anyway. The first time you encounter one of these pads, it's hooked up to a terminal (a cash register) where you input the base-10 (regular) number, and it's converted to the corresponding Villein number on the pad. However, I totally missed that it also worked the other way around! I didn't realize you could draw on the pad and then get the decimal number out of it.

Not only do you not need to learn the number system properly because of the two-way pad in the garage and the auto-correct feature, the only numbers you need to input after the initial one are 0 (empty pad) and 1023 (full pad). That's it. And you can brute-force the latter.


The Compass Puzzle
------------------

This puzzle is also found early on. You need to find a 6-digit number, and you're given a hint: "The solution is left under the direction of the first mayor". The first mayor was named Luther Roscoe (as you find out easily in the mayor's office), and there are two compasses on the mayor's desk, one within a wooden box labelled "Roscoe".

I tried a bunch of different avenues here. There's a graveyard nearby, with Luther Roscoe's grave looking a bit peculiar since the plank with Roscoe's name on it has two blank planks underneath it. "Under the direction of our first mayor", remember. I looked at these planks, walked in all directions from the grave, etc. Nothing

The compasses were too intimately tied to "directions" to discount, and one of them being labelled "Roscoe" had to be important. That compass just spun wildly. The other one didn't seem to have a needle, but the directions were labelled in a weird way – west had an "O". So counter-clockwise, the directions read N O S E. Was the solution right "under" my "nose"?

Why, yes, it was. I didn't realize you could turn the compass around while holding it. There was a note "under" the compass with the solution. (Okay, not the direct solution, but the rest was fairly easy to solve.)

The fake mayor
--------------

Cyan removed the screens

non-sequitur

Sure, in the original game it didn't make much sense for a Villein to show you the human representation fo the number 222. For one thing, I don't know if they know the human number system... But secondly, the number pad is operated with Villein numbers. Well, I guess perhaps she showed you the human number so you could look it up in the log book, which has human numbers, to see what person it corresponded to.

When Cyan removed the number hint, though, they destroyed this puzzle. You now have to guess what the Villein wants you to do, or stumble upon it yourself and not understand how you progressed. And for what?

Presumably Cyan though the original hint was too blatant. I'm inclined to agree a little. But does it matter? Surely the puzzle wasn't to figure out what to do, but how to input the number 222 using the Villein number system?


The remaining "big" puzzles in Obduction are good, though. Each of the different worlds have different "big" puzzles, and navigation through them (and between them) are puzzles in themselves.
