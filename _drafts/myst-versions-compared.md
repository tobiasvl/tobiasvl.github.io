Myst (1993)
-----------

The original game, released on CD-ROM in 1993.

Myst: Masterpiece Edition (1999)
--------------------------------

This version is a remaster of the original. The images have been rendered in 24-bit colors, and the sound is higher quality.

Some Quality of Life additions have been made: There's now a "Zip Mode" where you can quickly go to a place in the distance that you've visited before, you can turn on or off transitions between images, and you can drop a page you're carrying. There's also a helpful map for each Age in the settings.

Unfortunately, a couple of bugs also snuck in.

realMYST
--------

This is a full remake of Myst in realtime 3D, with free WASD movement.

Although this game wasn't too well received when it was released (Robyn Miller, one of the co-creators of Myst, famously derided it), it has aged the worst of the Myst versions, and it still has problems with performance, I've always had a soft spot for this version.

The environments have had a lot of care put into them. All of the Ages now have day/night cycles, which is amazing. There are weather effects; there is now a storm on Stoneship, with rain, waves, and lightning off in the horizon.

A gravestone for Ti'ana is now located behind the cabin in the woods on Myst Island. (Ti'ana or Anna, Atrus's grandmother, first appeared in the novel _Myst: The Book of Atrus_.)

And finally, a whole new Age is added as a bonus after completing the game: Rime. There's a new Rime journal in the Library (accessible from the beginning of the game), and after completing the game, a second Rime journal is on the floor in the Library (presumably dropped by Atrus as he burned the Red and Blue Books) which contains instructions on how to reach the Rime Linking Book in its Place of Protection.

realMYST: Masterpiece Edition
-----------------------------

After realMYST received a lukewarm reception, a new remake was released in 2013. Made in Unity, this is still a modern game by today's standards. It performs well.

There are still day/night cycles, but they're different, and not on all Ages. It is now perpetual night on Stoneship (in the original Myst, it was a sort of dusk), which gives it a different feeling. Also, it's very dark. However, you now have a flashlight, which is pretty weird in itself. There's still a storm, of course. And the skyboxes are gorgeous, especially on Stoneship.
