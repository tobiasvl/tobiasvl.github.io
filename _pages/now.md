An overview of what is going on in my life right [now](https://nownownow.com/about). Last updated 2025-02-16.

- Here in Oslo the sun is currently up before 8, and still up by 5, so I'm getting some sunshine outside of working hours.
- My two kids are 10 and 6 years old. The youngest is starting school in the fall!
- (Still) working at the University of Oslo as Team Lead for IAM.
- Winter biking on my Tern GSD e-bike every day.
- Continuing to run, which I started last year, and planning to run in [Holmenkollstafetten](https://holmenkollstafetten.no/) in May.
- Working on a few different blog posts (it's been a while since my last one).
- Reading (and trying to write some) haiku.
- Doing various Game Boy ROM hacking:
	- Working on the [*The Legend of Zelda - Link's Awakening* disassembly](https://github.com/zladx/LADX-Disassembly) for fun.
	- Various other stuff for [*Link's Awakening*](https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=37024.msg444307#msg444307).
	- Flipull DX (a colorized version of Flipull, a 1990 Game Boy game).
