An overview of what is going on in my life right [now](https://nownownow.com/about). Last updated 2025-11-05.

- Just got out from a three-week stint in the hospital after contracting _E. coli_ and getting hemolytic uremic syndrome. Do not recommend.
- It’s getting darker here in Oslo, and my mood and energy levels are taking a toll.
- My two kids are 10 and 6 years old. The youngest recently started school, and is thriving.
- (Still) working at the University of Oslo as Team Lead for IAM.
- Commuting on my Tern GSD e-bike every day.
- Still working on a few different blog posts (it's been a while since my last one).
- Reading (and trying to write some) haiku.
- Doing various Game Boy ROM hacking:
	- Working on the [*The Legend of Zelda - Link's Awakening* disassembly](https://github.com/zladx/LADX-Disassembly) for fun.
	- Various other stuff for [*Link's Awakening*](https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=37024.msg444307#msg444307).
	- Flipull DX (a colorized version of Flipull, a 1990 Game Boy game).
