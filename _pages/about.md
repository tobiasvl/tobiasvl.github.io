I'm a Python developer by day, father of two by afternoon and weekends, and a hobby game developer by night.

I like making games in small, restrictive game environments such as PICO-8, CHIP-8, bitsy, Game Boy, etc.

One of my hobbies is retro computing. My favorite period is the one that ended not long before I was born, prior to the PC revolution. DIY kit computers, 8-bit assembler language, and CHIP-8 are all topics that I'll probably blog about.
