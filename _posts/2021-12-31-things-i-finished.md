A summary of things I "finished" in 2021, with comments.

<!--more-->

The list of things I _didn't_ finish in 2021 would be much longer. I pretty much stopped reading halfway through the year. Not uncommon for me, but usually I pick it up again in the fall. This year I replaced it with other hobbies, like running and making music (hopefully I'll have something of the latter to put on my 2021 list).
