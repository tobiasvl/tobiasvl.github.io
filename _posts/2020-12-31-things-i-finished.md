A summary of things I "finished" in 2020, with comments.

<!--more-->

The list of things I _didn't_ finish in 2020 would be much longer. I pretty much stopped reading halfway through the year. Not uncommon for me, but usually I pick it up again in the fall. This year I replaced it with other hobbies, like running and making music (hopefully I'll have something of the latter to put on my 2021 list).

### Games I played

* **Animal Crossing**: My Switch says I've played it for 65 hours. I didn't really get sucked in, with landscaping etc, but I played it a bunch with my daughter and she loved it.
* **Deliver Us The Moon**: Walking simulator-esque puzzle set on the moon. The gameplay wasn't exactly this game's strongest suit, but I really liked the atmosphere and the story.
* **Obduction**: A new game by Cyan, who created the Myst series, some of my favorite games ever. Besides a few baffling puzzle design decisions, this definitely delivered.
* **Alan Wake**: OK, OK, I first finished this gem of a game in 2012 or so, but to get up to speed before _Control_'s tie-in DLC dropped, I played through it on Nightmare difficulty and gathered all the collectibles. Still holds up!
* **Control: The Foundation and AWE**: The DLC was still as fun as the base game, but also still very light on narrative. Holding out hope for _Alan Wake 2_.
* **Spelunky**: I played this a bunch years ago on Xbox Live Arcade, but in preparation for the sequel I picked it up on Steam and started doing the Daily Challenge every day.
* **Spelunky 2**: How could this improve on one of the most perfect games ever? Turns out, in pretty much every way imaginable. But it _is_ imaginable; it's more of the same, just better and more expansive.
* **Observation**: Fun "walking simulator" where you're not walking at all, but controlling the cameras of an AI aboard a space station that gets into some 2001 shit.
* **Alien: Isolation**: I'm a huge _Alien_ (1979) fan, and I bought this game back in 2013, but for some reason I never got super far. This Halloween I decided I had to get it off my backlog, and I loved every single minute of it. Amazing experience and a must play for any horror fan.
* **Stories Untold**: Made by the people who made _Observation_, and also the UI for _Alien: Isolation_, this is a collection of retrofuturistic puzzle/point and click games where the narrative is like _Dear Esther_ just easier to understand.
* **Five Nights at Freddy's**: Never played this hit game before, and I must say I was pretty underwhelmed.
